# Minecraft Mod with MCForge

## Project Abstract
The purpose of this project is the creation of a mod for the game Minecraft using Minecraft Forge, an open-source project that allows Java developers to view and modify the game’s code as well as load mods into a running instance of the game. I intend for this project to include the addition of relatively simple quality-of-life improvements for Minecraft’s basic gameplay loop. I plan to add new items to the game as well as additional functionalities for existing items.
